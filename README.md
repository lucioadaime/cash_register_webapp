## Usage

### Adding and Removing Items

1. On the **Main Menu** page, use the form to add items to your cart by entering the product code.
2. The cart, displayed on the top right, shows a list of added items with quantities and total price.
3. To remove an item, enter its product code in the remove form.

### Checkout Process

2. If the cart is empty, you will see an error message prompting you to add items.
3. On successful checkout, youâ€™ll be taken to a confirmation page with a thank-you message and a link to continue shopping.
